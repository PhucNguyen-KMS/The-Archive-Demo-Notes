Saved searches are one of the advancements from the nv-Core.[[201705110850]]

While working with nvALT, we recognized that we performed the same searches over and over again. A good example is a search for tags [[201705120948]] that concern your current writing project. You will want to get back to the same collection of notes again and again, repeating the search all the time.

Remember the importance of speed we mentioned in the note about the nv-Core? Speed is one of the central paradigms we used to make decisions about this app's features, and saved searches are a great help.

For every step you do repeatedly, there ought to be a fast solution or you will cease to use this solution. This is one reason, by the way, why some apps don't *feel* right. They repeatedly force us into clunky work flows.
