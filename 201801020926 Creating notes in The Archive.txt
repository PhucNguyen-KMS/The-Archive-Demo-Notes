# 201801020926 Creating notes in The Archive
#archive #creation

There are a different ways to create a note, each with pros and cons depending on your workflow. 

1. Type the note title you want into the Omnibar and hit the return key. If you type a term in the Omnibar that is not used as the name of a note already, *The Archive* will create a matching note for you; if a note exists, it will be opened instead. 
2. Use a Wiki-Link: create a link that leads nowhere, click on it to follow the link, then create a note from the Omnibar as in (2).[[201705091535]] The Wiki-link feature is built on top of the search. Similar rules apply to entering a term in the Omnibar: if a note with the linked text exists, it will be displayed for you. If there is no matching note, you can hit the return key from within the Omnibar to create a note with the title set to the search term.
3. Create an empty note in *The Archive* without changing your search. Just hit ⌘N (or pick 'Note > New' from the menu). The Archive will create a note for you that will be named "Untitled" and take you right into the editor. After you complete the note you can rename it by hitting ⌘R (or via 'Note > Rename' from the main menu).
4. Use the "Quick Entry" popup window from anywhere on your system to capture a thought. You have to configure the shortcut in the application preferences (⌘,) to make it globally accessible.
