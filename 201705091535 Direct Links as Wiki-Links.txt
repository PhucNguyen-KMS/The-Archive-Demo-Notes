In *The Archive*, if you put an ID in double brackets you create a direct link to the note that starts with the ID.[[201801232029]] All double brackets with IDs in them you have encountered so far are basically a clickable search in *The Archive*, selecting the best literal match of the search term to display by default.

The search results include all the notes that refer to this particular target. For example: If you search for `201705091535` by clicking on [[201705091535]], the search results include two notes:

1. This note. You searched for it.
2. "Connection of notes". That note refers to this note. It contains the ID in double brackets, as `[[201705091535]]`.

This means that a direct link refers to a particular note via its ID and shows you all the backlinks to that note. This gives you a bit of an overview for the context of the searched note. This context will become handy when your archive grows and navigating in it becomes harder.

Since double bracketed links are performing a search under the hood, you can put the whole title in double brackets, too, like this: [[201705091531 Connections of notes]]

You can also create links into The Archive from other applications using the built-in URL scheme.[[201801231551]]
