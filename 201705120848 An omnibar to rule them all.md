# 201705120848 An Omnibar to rule them all
#archiveapp-demo #search

The Omnibar is the place to interact with your archive. It's the search-and-create box at the top of the app, similar to a web browser.

Imagine *The Archive* as a remote control for your directory of plain text files. Familiarize yourself with the shortcut to access the Omnibar quickly from anywhere: âŒ˜L. You'll need this a lot to navigate in your archive.

When the Omnibar is focused, you can use the arrow keys to navigate around in the list of found notes. No need to click inside the search result list with the mouse. Hit Tab to get back to the note editor quickly.
