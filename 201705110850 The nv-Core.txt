# 201705110850 The nv-Core
#nvALT #archiveapp-demo

The core of our app is derived from [Notational Velocity][nv] and its popular fork, [nvALT][]. Why? It is the fastest app for note taking. We used the nvALT branch during recent years. The "nv" core delivers the speed and ease of use to the archive.

We stand on the shoulders of giants and make it a point to honor the ancestors of the archive.

Why is speed so important? The reason is found in basic psychology. The more you do something the more important small aspects become. I don't mind losing a second or two when I wait for the bus. I don't do it very often. But a second or two can be **a lot** when it comes to repeating steps in the archive. 

Speed is important because it is one of the main determinants on how smooth the app can bend around your actions.
