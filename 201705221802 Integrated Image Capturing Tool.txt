#images #archiveapp-demo

The image capturing tool (⌥⌘M) is for integration of images into your work flow. Especially, if you draw a diagram or something similar.

You should draw. Drawing is good for your brain and it improves your productivity.[^1][^2] Images are *the* way to capture flows, systems, and wholenesses in general. But drawing with the mouse or with the touchpad is pesky and very few people have a pen tablet. So you're better off drawing with pen and paper. Also, in general, drawing by hand is faster, more precise, more engaging and more fun. 
  
The image capturing tool is a shortcut from your real-world desk into your digital archive.

Before *The Archive*, users would have had to take pictures with their phones, pair them with their Mac, move the image file into the right directory, and finally add a the Markdown [[201801231614]] syntax. Now, you can just take the damn picture and have it where you need it.

Remember the importance of speed? [[201705110850]] The image capturing tool, in all it's beautiful simplicity, is another factor to reduce friction and increase speed. Image capturing allows you to integrate your pencil and your keyboard. 

Try it yourself: Select "Edit > Capture Image..." and insert a photo from a drawing in this note!
